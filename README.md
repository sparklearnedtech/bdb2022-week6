# BDB2022 Week 6 Exercise

For week 6, you will be developing a simple blockchain explorer for ETH and ERC20 transactions. You can either use mainnet or testnet. This will be an application of what you've learned for this week.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/sparklearnedtech/bdb2022-week6.git`.
2. Create your own branch using this format (firstname-lastname), checkout, and make sure you are not on main branch.
	```
	git branch john-doe    // create branch using firstname-lastname format
	git checkout john-doe  // checkout on newly created branch
	git branch             // check and make sure you are currently on your john-doe branch, not main
	```
3. Run `npm install` to generate your `node_modules` folder and download all necessary packages.
5. Then run `npm start` to check the web app and start coding.
4. Once you're done, just message [@harveyjavier](https://github.com/harveyjavier) on Slack, and he will check your branch.
